# Introduction
## What is Security?
Security is simply hiding or otherwise obscuring information, either while it is traveling or when we store it, to prevent some attacker from accessing this information. Security is a must in the modern, computerised world, where data is money. Imagine Finance, or Military Compuation, or even something as simple as social networks without security preventing snooping eyes, benign or otherwise.

Throughout this course, we will be studying Cryptography, Access Control, And best operational procedures to secure a system.

First and foremost, we need to know that the single weakest point in any security system is that there will be people using this system. We should try to find ways to foolproof systems, but human error is the most random and dangerous factor.
